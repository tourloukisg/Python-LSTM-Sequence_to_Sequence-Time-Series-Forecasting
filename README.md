# Python-LSTM-Sequence_to_Sequence-Time-Series-Forecasting

This work presents two case studies that demonstrate the use of the LSTM Deep Learning model for 'sequence to sequence' time series forecasting, based on two datasets comprising monthly alcohol and beer sales records. PART A of this project is focused on data preparation/manipulation of the imported dataset features (Alcohol_Sales and Beer_Sales) to apply all necessary data preprocessing/cleaning methods by use of numpy and pandas (i.e. adding new column to the dataframe, rename column,'date' feature conversion to datetime object and use as index, feature engineering to extract datetime categories,identification and dropping of rows with missing entries,mapping). Moreover, an exploratory analysis is provided in this section to highlight key aspects of both dataset time series with respect to their past observations, so as to get meaningful insights in terms of their distribution, correlations, and their behavior when grouped at different time periods.

In the second part of this demonstration (Part B), the forecasting capabilities of the LSTM model are investigated. In Case Study I, the LSTM model is trained to forecast the total amount of beer sales (univariate time series) over the next 12 months, by creating a time series input sequence of 12 time steps and an output sequence of the same length(one-step ahead) consisting of the monthly 'Beer_Sales' feature with the initial sequence being X[index 0:11] and y[index 12:23]. The last 12 month values of the 'Beer_Sales' feature comprise the X_test values that are used as LSTM inputs, after the end of the training process, to predict the new 'Beer_Sales' sequence.

The main difference between Case Study I and Case Study II is that in the latter the LSTM output (Beer Sales - dependent LSTM parameter) is determined by using the 'Alcohol Sales' feature as the LSTM input (independent parameter) during the training process of the neural network model. Dataset is split into training and test samples so as to use the X_test samples as the new LSTM model inputs and the y_test samples for the comparison of the expected (target) and the forecasted LSTM values. For the evaluation of the LSTM model performance, plots of the forecasted values against the actual(test) Beer Sales values are presented (Performance Metric --> Root Mean Squared Error).

The Dataset (.csv file format) for this project has been obtained from Kaggle:
